Chickenpox (varicella) is a viral infection that causes an itchy rash with small, fluid-filled blisters. Chickenpox is highly contagious to people who haven't had the disease or been vaccinated against it. Before routine chickenpox vaccination, virtually all people had been infected by the time they reached adulthood, sometimes with serious complications. Today, the number of cases and hospitalizations is down dramatically.

<h2 style="background-color:coral;">PREVENTION:</h2>
<p style="font-size:150%"> 
	**Stay away from people who are sick with chickenpox or shingles, if possible.<br/><br/>
	**Wear disposable, non-latex gloves when touching objects or<br/> surfaces that may have been exposed to the virus.<br/><br/>
	**On cruise ships, crew members with chickenpox often are instructed to wear<br/> long sleeves and long pants to decrease the number of<br/> blisters other people may be exposed.<br/><br/>
